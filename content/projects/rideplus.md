An application for users to carpooling with your coworkers to commute between your company and your home. This course project mimics the actual workflow of creating a real-world application, including brainstorming user stories, designing UI/UX, maintaining codebase, and deploying with CI/CD. My part of work focuses on backend API design and implementation.
