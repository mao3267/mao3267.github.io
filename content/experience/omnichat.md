### Empowering possibilities through LLMs

In my journey to expand the practical application of my LLM research skills, I took on an AI Research Internship at OmniChat, where I delved into the dynamic intersection of software engineering and natural language processing. During this role, I contributed to the development of an "AI Customer Service Chatbot" by integrating retrieval-augmented generation with automated workflows, creating an end-to-end chatbot solution. My work also involved incorporating LLM agents into existing systems to streamline audience targeting and promotional workflow creation using intuitive, natural language commands. These experiences not only deepened my technical expertise in large language models but also offered valuable insights into the challenges and intricacies of building and maintaining NLP systems in an industry setting. Through this role, I witnessed firsthand the transformative impact of retrieval systems and LLM agents in solving complex problems and enhancing access to information.
